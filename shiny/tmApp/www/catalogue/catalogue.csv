Prime Minister John Key has indicated National will campaign on further changes to labour laws - and will not rule out reinstating a youth minimum wage or changes to collective bargaining. Employment law changes in New Zealand took effect 1 April and have given all employers the right to dismiss employees within a first 90-day "trial" period, with no rights to grievance procedure. This rule previously applied for small businesses of fewer than 20 employees. Now it applies in all workplaces, no matter the size of the workforce. The regressive changes also include restrictions on trade union access to a worksite, relaxation of fairness tests on dismissals, the ability of employers to bypass the union in collective negotiations, the possibility to exchange holiday days for money, the right to shift public holidays without payment, and the right for employers to demand a medical certificate for one day's sick leave.

Television match officials help with refereeing decisions during rugby matches, and may overturn those of the referees controlling the game on the ground.

All black news. 14 October 2011,The title of the top frame is 'All Black mania' and the cartoon shows an exhausted and wounded Wallaby with exultant kiwis wearing All Black strips dancing all over him; text reads 'All Black victors.' The title of the lower frame is 'All Black news' and the cartoon shows oil-covered seabirds and a crab on an oil-covered beach; text reads 'All Black victims.' Context: The term 'all black' describes both the 'All Blacks' and the oily slick from the doomed ship 'Rena.' The cartoon refers to the juxtaposition of the Rugby World Cup which fully engages attention and the wreck of the 'Rena' on the Astrolabe Reef off the coast of Tauranga. On 5th October 2011 the container ship 'Rena' became stuck on the Astrolabe reef off the coast of Tauranga. It is spilling oil, threatening coastlines and killing seabirds. Authorities are racing to get the oil and the containers off the ship before it breaks up but the weather is frustrating efforts.

Refers to a two-year old "psychic" octopus, who has achieved national celebrity status in Germany for having a 100 percent success rating in choosing match winners. English-born Paul the mollusk, who lives in The Sea Life Aquarium in Oberhausen, Germany, has so far chosen the winner for every match that Germany has played in, having predicted that Germany would beat Australia, Ghana, England and Argentina but lose to Serbia.

Text reads 'Closing the gap' and a huge Australian Rugby League player (Kangaroos) wearing a 'VB' (Victoria Bitter) shirt has his mouth taped up 'closing the gap'. Refers to the win by the Kiwis of the 'Four Nations' giving them the World Cup Rugby League title with a thrilling last-gasp 16-12 win over Australia in Brisbane. Economically speaking, however, 'closing the gap' refers to John Key's stated desire to close the economic gap between Australia and New Zealand. The '2025 Taskforce' was set up by the New Zealand government after the 2008 election to recommend how the gap between average incomes in Australia and New Zealand could be closed. Incomes of New Zealanders have generally risen less rapidly than those of Australians over the last 40 years, resulting in a gap between average incomes of around 35 percent in recent years. After the 2008 election, the NZ government committed to closing this income gap by 2025. Since the Taskforce presented its first report last year, Philip McCann - an economist with expertise in economic geography - has advanced the view that New Zealand's geographical disadvantages prevent it from becoming a high productivity economy. McCann has implied that structural features that are advantageous in the current era of globalization differ so much from those exhibited by New Zealand that this economy could not reasonably be expected to have relatively high productivity.

There has been some controversy over salary caps in rugby recently. The following definition is from Wikipedia.. In sports, a salary cap is a limit on the amount of money a team can spend on player salaries, either as a per-player limit or a total limit for the team's roster (or both). Several sports leagues have made salary caps mandatory, both as a method of keeping overall costs down, and in order to balance the league so a wealthy team cannot become dominant simply by buying all the top players. Salary caps are often the major issue in negotiations between management and players' unions.

The train is crammed and quite overloaded with people trying to get to a rugby match. Stephen Joyce says 'Don't worry we can fix this with more money for roads'. Context: The transport and overcrowding problems during the Rugby World Cup opening in Auckland caused some considerable embarrassment.

No sooner was their work in the public eye than the similarly flawed Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill was reported back from a select committee, with a recommendation that it pass. It also goes far beyond what is required to get things done. In bypassing the normal consent process, the bill says the authority does not have to hold hearings on applications and that its decisions can be challenged in the High Court only on points of law. Effectively, the legislation asks New Zealanders to accept that the Rugby World Cup Minister knows best. It is he who knows how the event must be run. Precisely the same attitude pervades the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act. This hands individual Government ministers the power to change almost every law, thereby handing Parliament's normal law-making role to the Executive. Their decisions cannot be challenged in any court'. (NZ Herald editorial - 1 October 2010)

In the fissure are dozens of eyes shining in the dark and people struggle to clamber out. A sign reads 'The Orange Zone. No fun - no parties - Come in and wait for nothing to happen!' Context: The 'Orange Zone' makes a wordplay on 'fanzone' the play spaces for Rugby World Cup revellers.

Originally it read 'Welcome to the All Whites' but the word 'Whites' has been crossed out and the word 'colours' is suggested as a replacement. In a second version the word 'whites' on the banner is followed by 'and blacks and reds and browns, and yellows, and reds [again but crossed out] blues and ... all colours'. Text explains that 'remembering a recent apology from another South African football code, the organisers of the FIFA World Cup quickly amended the airport banner'. Refers to the landmark apologies made by New Zealand and South Africa's rugby unions for excluding Maori and black players from their teams during the apartheid era. The FIFA World Cup (football/soccer) kicks off on the 11th June 2010. There are ten venues but Johannesburg is dubbed 'Soccer City'.

One shows Prime Minister Helen Clark and another minister (probably Trevor Mallard) as gladiators in a Roman arena filled with spectators. The minister says: "Don't blame me Helen, apparently its the stadium option most preferred by Aucklanders". Refers to a proposal for 'Stadium New Zealand' on the Auckland waterfront. The stadium was intended for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, although it never advanced beyond a concept design and was widely contested. The second cartoon shows Helen Clark standing at a Press Room lectern while a garbage-covered Mallard stands behind her. Clark says: "The idea that we would hire an investigator to go through rubbish bins is absolutely preposterous, right Trevor?" Wider context includes Mallard's allegations in the house regarding National Party members.

Other pieces of debris in the sand are labeled 'Australia', 'Party Central' and 'Bike way'. The cartoon suggests that each of the broken pieces of debris represent failed enterprises. The bike way which promised 3700 jobs has created only 138. The plans for Auckland's Party Central Rugby World Cup fans' partying place have are proving very problematic and John Key seems in danger of involving New Zealand in Australia's election battle over the boat people issue.

She suggests to her husband who is in bed that she might need to change her name to 'Garden Place' so that she can keep getting expensive makeovers. Refers to the $3.7 million attempt to breathe life into Garden Place, Hamilton's CBD, that has been backed by city councillors. Key features of plans signed off by councillors last night included a low-speed road linking Worley Place and Alexandra Street. The curved brick walls would be replaced with steps and dramatic pop-up ground-level fountains. A permanent stage, movable planter boxes and an outside reading room next to the library are also planned as part of a design which aims to provide a platform for creativity and a social hub in the heart of the city.The entire revamp will be completed in time for the Rugby World Cup in 2011, with physical works to open up the space and remove "visual clutter", including the Peace Wall completed before Christmas.
